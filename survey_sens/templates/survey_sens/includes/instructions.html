            Two participants take part in this study: you and another random user of Toloka.
        </div>
        <div>
            Each participant will receive one of two roles: Sender or Receiver.
        </div>
        <div>
            The roles are determined randomly. You will find out what role you got as soon as you answer the short
            questionnaire.
        </div>
        <div>
            Depending on the role, you can either change the bonus that you and the other participant will get or not.

        </div>
        <div>
            The study proceeds as follows:
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You will first fill in a short questionnaire.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then you will be randomly assigned to one of two roles (Sender or Receiver)
            </li>
            <li>
                The participant who receives the role of Sender will make a decision that affects the bonus of both
                participants.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div>
            <div><b>
                Decision:
            </b></div>
            <div>

                The Sender has the option to split $ 1 (100 cents) between the Receiver and himself. The Sender decides
                how much of the amount he sends to the Receiver. The rest of the amount remains for the Sender.
            </div>

            <div>
                The part of 100 cents that the Sender decided to send to the Recipient will be paid to the Recipient in
                the form of a Toloka bonus.
            </div>
            <div>
                The remaining part of 100 cents will be paid to the Sender as a Toloka bonus.
            </div>

            <p>
                Thus, the Sender can affect the bonus received in Toloka by both participants, but the Recipient cannot.
