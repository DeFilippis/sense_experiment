    <div class="my-3">
        In this study, you will make decisions and interact with another randomly selected user of Toloka in real
        time. Therefore, there may be pauses in the game, during which you need to wait for your opponent.
    </div>
    <div  class="my-3"  >
        The study consists of two parts: short questionnaire and the decision making task. We explain the details of
        the tasks at the next page.
    </div>

    <p>
        For participation you will receive ${{ session.config.toloka_participation_fee|floatformat:2 }}, which will be
        paid after you send the correct code in the Toloka interface. You will be shown this code immediately after
        completing the research.



    <p>
        You can earn extra money (up to $ 1) that will be paid to you as a bonus in Toloka.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next page you will be provided with instructions describing the course of the study.
